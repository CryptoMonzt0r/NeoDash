Neodash Core Community Takeover
===============================



What is Neodash?
----------------

Neodash is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Neodash uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Neodash Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

NeoDash is a new decentralized digital currency.
Continuing on from the success and hardwork of Bitcoin and Dash.
It uses a hash algorithm NeoScrypt perfected by Ghostlander https://github.com/ghostlander/NeoScrypt, and is adapted for normal miners 
who do not have access to sophisticated mining hardware. 
Neoscrypt is protected from ASIC.
The indisputable advantage of NeoDash is a more cogent accrual of reward for the found block. 50% goes to the miners, 
and 50% to the Masternodes.
